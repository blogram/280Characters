# TweetDeck in #280Characters

Twitter has [released 280-character tweeting](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html), but only to a small group of people during a trial period. This Chrome extension adds the ability for everyone to tweet in 280 characters on [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) ~~and [Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/)~~.

[Install the extension on the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-and-tweetdeck-in/bjihepmioccbfbkdcniidckifnkagbmp).

[Install the Add-ons for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tweetdeck-280/).

The source code is available here on GitHub and pull requests are invited.

This extension works thanks to tricks by [@Zemnmez](https://twitter.com/Zemnmez/status/912876877391335424) and [@Prof9](https://twitter.com/Prof9/status/912859110776950784). It's likely Twitter will modify their systems to prevent these hacks, so don't be surprised if it stops working.

*Update Sept 28: The party is over at twitter.com, which now [appears to be validating tweet length at the server](https://github.com/quinncomendant/280Characters/issues/2), so this extension no longer enables 280-character tweets there. But it still works at [tweetdeck.twitter.com](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/)!* ðŸŽ‰
